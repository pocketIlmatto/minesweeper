#Minesweeper

Very basic minesweeper game created as an exercise to practice javascript, jQuery and some html/css.  

####Features
* User-defined map size and mine count
* Basic minesweeper rules enforced
  * Uncover a mine, and the game ends.
  * Uncover an empty square, and you keep playing.
  * Uncover a number, and it tells you how many mines lay hidden in the eight surrounding squaresâ€”information you use to deduce which nearby squares are safe to click.

####Possible future work
* Timer
* Flags
* Auto-uncover connecting blank pieces
* Leaderboard
